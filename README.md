# Netflix-Frontend-Clone
This project is a clone of Netflix's frontend, built with modern web technologies. The goal is to replicate the user interface and some functionalities of Netflix, providing a similar look and feel to the original platform.
Here I have used HTML,CSS and some Photos and Video files to make it more realistic.
